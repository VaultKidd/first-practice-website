                Humans or Homospaiens first arose around 300,000 years ago in
                Africa. Over the next 100-125 thousand years, humans would
                wonder around the Earth and settle in tribes across the
                continents as we know them today. Early humans eventually
                learned to make tools out of rocks and stones such as axes,
                spears and knives, and began hunting things which in the past,
                used to hunt them.

                Due to the new food available to humans through hunting and
                gathering, we learned to use our brains more efficiently and
                started developing things such as agriculture. Through
                agriculture and irrigation, humans now had to worry less about
                daily survival, and more about learning new things to expand our
                understanding of the world. Agriculture eventually led to the
                formation of small villages, and these small villages ended up
                being assimilated into towns, which then needed someone to rule
                over them.

                Civilization as we know it first came around 3,000 years ago
                with the rise of the Sumer in Mesapotamia. Which then spanned a
                whole conglomerate of people following suit.

                Over the next 5,000 years civilisations would rise and fall,
                with many notable ones being the Ancient Egyptians, Indus
                Valley, China, Ancient Greeks, Romans, Byzantines and many many
                more up until the modern day. Civilisations would battle with
                each other over land, resources and pride, and due to the
                decisions of many before us, we are at this point today, with
                the technology and knowledge all thanks to the civilisations and
                empires before us.

                Modern day has placed us in the information age. Media and the
                internet allows us to access million of pieces of information
                which has been collected throughout ancient history as well as
                new information created every single day. This age is seeing us
                accelerate faster and faster into the unknown, and with many
                modern bright minds driving us towards even greater cultural and
                technological development, the world ahead of us is whatever we
                decide to make it, as long as we don't drive ourselves to
                extinction, as many advanced and ingenious civilizations before
                us, have.
